# Gamecube controller cherry mx trigger full print
## Warnings
The trigger may not fit on the first print and may need to be scaled by a percent or two. Otherwise a small amount of dremel work is required. In addition you need to soder the leads of the mx key to the appropriate trigger in order to use it.

## Files
There are two files one for each trigger. They are designed to be a very close fit to the inside of the case, **I recommend printing at 99-98% scaling** depending on the dimentational accuracy of your printer

I have also included the step for a shortened version to seat lower into the controller(not well tested or reccomended). The default "tall" will still have no travel and should directly contact the mx key without hassle
