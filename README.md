# Gamecube controller cherry mx trigger full print
## Purpose
this replaces the need to use any trigger plugs or any additional hardware. besides having the Cherry MX switch and the trigger itself. no additional modifications should be needed or cuts to the Shell
## Warnings
The trigger may not fit on the first print and may need to be scaled by a percent or two. Otherwise a small amount of dremel work is required. In addition you need to soder the leads of the mx key to the appropriate trigger in order to use it.

## Files
There are two files one for each trigger. They are designed to be a very close fit to the inside of the case, 

**I recommend printing at 99-98% scaling** depending on the dimentational accuracy of your printer

I have also included the step for a shortened version to seat lower into the controller(not well tested or reccomended). The default "tall" will still have no travel and should directly contact the mx key without hassle

## **ADDITIONAL FILES NEEDED**
